# graph

This is the single Racket `graph` module extracted from
https://github.com/tonyg/mixfix. The same license
applies as in the original repository.

## Usage

Install with `raco pkg install git://github.com:oden-lang/graph.git` or by
using the same Git URL in your `info.rkt` deps.

Then you should be able to `(require graph)` in Racket.
